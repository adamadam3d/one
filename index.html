    <p><p>Introduction:</p>

    <p>For centuries, people have used art and clothing to express themselves; when the two are combined, you get tattoos. There is a controversy surrounding tattoos, with some viewing them as unprofessional or distasteful, while others see them as a form of self-expression and personal identity. This issue is important. As tattoos become increasingly common, it is crucial that they are not discriminated against in the workplace or in society. I argue that tattoos should be accepted and embraced as a legitimate form of art and self-expression.</p>
        
    <p>Opposing Claim:</p>
        
        <p>One common argument argued by (Goldring, 2022)against tattoos is that they are unprofessional and can hurt a person's chances of getting a job. In today's workplace, appearances are often considered important, and a tattoo may be seen as a hindrance to that. It is true that tattoos can be seen as unprofessional by some people, and this may impact a person's employment prospects. However, this attitude is gradually changing as more and more people get tattoos and society becomes more accepting of them. Additionally, it is unfair to judge a person's professionalism based on their appearance, and an employer who discriminates against tattoos is missing out on a potentially valuable employee.</p>
        
        <p>Supportive Claim:</p>
        
        <p>Another argument argued by (Donnelly, 2020) and(Parton, 2022) in favor of tattoos is that they can be a form of self-expression and personal identity. For many people, tattoos are a way to showcase their values, beliefs, and passions. They can serve as a reminder of important events or people in a person's life, or simply as a way to express themselves creatively. In this way, tattoos can be seen as a form of art, with the human body serving as the canvas. Furthermore, tattoos can be a source of empowerment and self-confidence for those who choose to get them. By embracing their individuality and personal style, individuals with tattoos can feel more comfortable in their own skin and be more confident in their daily lives.</p>
        
       <P> Conclusion:</p>
        
        <p>In conclusion, I wholeheartedly support tattoos, which should be accepted as a form of art. Tattoos not only become a part of a person's identity, but they also provide that person with a sense of empowerment and confidence. If tattoos are not accepted in society, we risk ostracising people.</p></p>
